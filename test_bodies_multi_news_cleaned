2539,"– You may have heard that eggs are good for you, but a new study in the journal Atherosclerosis suggests they're not so good for you after all. Researchers found that people who ate five or more eggs a day had a 30% higher risk of coronary heart disease than did those who ate just one egg a day. In other words, they're as bad as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, reports the Los Angeles Times. So what's the point of eating eggs if you're going to have a heart attack? Researchers aren't sure, but they suggest a low-fat, plant-based diet, along with plenty of exercise and a healthy diet in general, could help."

A new study out of Canada suggests that the more eggs you eat, the thicker your artery walls become—and that the effect is almost as bad as smoking cigarettes, the Los Angeles Times reports. Researchers at Western University in Canada found that the more eggs people ate, the thicker their artery walls became—and that the effect was almost as bad as smoking cigarettes. In fact, the more eggs people ate, the more likely they were to have a heart attack, stroke, or coronary heart disease, according to a press release."

2543,"– You may have heard that saturated animal fats are bad for you, but did you know they can also be bad for your heart? Conventional medical authorities say so, but a century ago, fewer than one in 100 Americans were obese, and coronary heart disease was unknown, reports the Los Angeles Times. Now, researchers at the University of Utah say they've found that high levels of saturated animal fats in the diet can actually increase your risk of heart disease. In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers say that a diet high in saturated animal fats can raise your risk of coronary heart disease by as much as 30%. The researchers, who say they've never before studied the effects of high levels of saturated animal fats, also found that people who ate a diet high in saturated animal fats were more likely to be obese than people who ate a diet low in saturated animal fats. The researchers say that by consuming a diet high in saturated animal fats, they were able to increase the risk of coronary heart disease by 30%."
2544,"– Consuming a lot of saturated fat on a regular basis has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, but is it actually bad for you? That's the upshot of a new study published in the British Medical Journal.

The study also found that people who ate a diet high in saturated fat were twice as likely to have a heart attack than those who ate a low- saturated-fat diet. The authors of the study, which looked at data going back to the 1970s, say more research is needed to confirm their findings and that more studies are needed to see if the effects of saturated fat on a person's heart health are permanent or temporary, the Times reports. The study also found that people who ate a diet high in saturated fat were twice as likely to have a heart attack than those who ate a low- saturated-fat diet. The authors of the study say that people who ate a diet high in saturated fat were more likely to have a heart attack than people who"
2545,"–Saturated fats have long been called ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart. But a new analysis calls in question whether they're really that bad after all. The New York Times takes a look at the science behind the so-called ""bad fats."" They're found in animal products like lard and butter, and they've been linked to heart disease because of their ability to raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. But a team of researchers led by Dr. Supat Thammasitboon of Thailand's National School of Tropical Medicine and Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology that there's no evidence that these fats actually increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. What they did find, however, is that those who consumed the most of the so-called ""bad fats"" (ie, those found in animal products like lard and butter) had a lower risk of dying from heart attack or stroke than did those who consumed the least of them. The researchers theorize that because the saturated fats are found in plant-based oils like canola and grapeseed, their effects on the heart may not be as pronounced as previously thought."
2546,"– The saturated fat in bacon, butter, and other meat products is not only bad for you, it's been shown to increase your risk of heart disease, the New York Times reports. A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that people who ate a diet high in saturated fat, which is found in meat, eggs, butter, and cheese, were more likely to be obese than those who ate a diet low in saturated fat, which is found in fruits and vegetables. The study also found that people who ate a diet high in saturated fat were twice as likely to be obese than those who ate a diet low in saturated fat. The American Heart Association recommends a diet low in saturated fat, which is found in meat, eggs, butter, and cheese, and is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. A recent study found that people who ate a diet high in saturated fat were three times more likely to be obese than those who ate a diet low in saturated fat. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a diet low in saturated fat, which is found in meat, eggs, butter, and cheese, and is linked to a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes."

HIIT is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training, and it's been shown to increase a person's risk of heart disease and cancer. But, according to a press release, it could also be doing more harm than good. High-intensity training can also weaken the body's ability to fight off free radicals, which are the harmful chemicals that are linked to heart disease and cancer. So, if you're considering doing HIIT and aren't used to it, you may want to think twice."

2551,"– The American College of Sports Medicine is calling for more research into the benefits of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, for people who suffer from a wide range of health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, pulmonary disease, arthritis, and Parkinson’s disease. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that people who performed at least 75 minutes of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT) three times a week for at least a year saw a 15% reduction in their risk of dying from heart disease and a 30% reduction in their risk of dying prematurely from any cause compared to those who only performed 30 minutes or less of HIIT once a week for at least a year. People who performed at least 75 minutes of HIIT twice a week for at least a year saw a 10% reduction in their risk of dying prematurely from any cause compared to those who only performed 30 minutes or less of HIIT once a week for at least a year. The researchers behind the study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, say more research is needed to confirm their findings, but they believe that people with a wide range of health conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, should consider doing HIIT for as long as they can before stopping their exercise"

2568,"– The FDA has issued a warning to consumers about eating foods made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, reports the Los Angeles Times. The warning, issued after a review of dozens of studies, warns that certain GM foods could pose a health risk to consumers. The agency says it wants more research to be done on the effects of such foods on human health, but it's not going to force companies to disclose the content of their products.

2579,"– President Obama's claim that climate change is caused by humans is just plain wrong, according to a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn't exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers,"" the panel writes.

2581,"– One of the biggest losers in the Affordable Care Act's first year was Molina Healthcare, which lost $110 million on the ObamaCare exchanges. Now, the company says it won't participate in any of the Affordable Care Act's six-month open enrollment periods, Bloomberg reports. ""There are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017,"" says CEO Alfred Molina. That's a big deal, because the company is one of the ""bright spots"" in the ACA, and it's one of the biggest insurers on the exchanges, USA Today reports. UnitedHealth, another major insurer on the exchanges, recently projected losses several times higher than Molina's. But that's not why Molina's exit is such a big deal. ""Because Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed, by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business, as one of the 'bright spots,'"" writes Matthew Yglesias at USA Today. ""Why spend so much time looking at one modest-size insurer? Because Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed, by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business, as one of the 'bright spots.'"""

2584,"– The Congressional Budget Office is out with a report predicting that the number of people insured under ObamaCare will drop next year if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the Wall Street Journal reports. The CBO says that if ObamaCare is left in place, the number of uninsured people under the age of 65 will drop from 26 million this year to 26 million next year. That's a drop of about 2 million people. The nonpartisan agency says that if the Affordable Care Act is left in place, the number of uninsured people will drop from 34 million this year to 26 million next year. But that's a conservative estimate. The New York Times reports that the CBO's simulations seem to be ""impeded by reality."" In the real world, ObamaCare exchanges are in crisis, millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. But for CBO, ObamaCare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if ObamaCare is left in place. To hit that mark, 2 million would have to lose their coverage."
2585,"– Illinois residents who buy their own insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act are about to feel the full force of the law's effects. The Chicago Tribune reports premiums for individual insurance policies could spike an average of 43% to 55% next year, thanks in large part to a slew of insurers leaving the ObamaCare market. Insurers including UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Land of Lincoln Health have all left the market, leaving Illinois with only three insurers selling policies on the state's exchanges. ""It's going to be a very tough year for consumers in Illinois,"" says an insurance analyst. ""The individual insurance market is the only one of its kind in the country where you have a lot of big companies leaving and a lot of small companies leaving as well."" The Tribune reports premiums for plans on the state's exchanges could jump as much as 30% next year."

""When it comes to meeting one of its most important goals—providing coverage to the uninsured—it is working extremely well,"" Walker tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview. ""It's posting historical gains on this front and, in so doing, both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents."" Walker has been a vocal critic of both ObamaCare and Donald Trump's health care plan, but he says he won't try to repeal the law as governor. ""I'm not going to do that,"" he says. ""I'm not going to do that for the American people."""
